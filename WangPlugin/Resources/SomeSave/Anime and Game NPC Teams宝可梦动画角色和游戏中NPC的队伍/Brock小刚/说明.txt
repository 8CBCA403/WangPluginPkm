About This File
Second in my anime fake events series for Gen 1, Brock. As usual, if a Pokemon used more than 4 moves on the anime, I included more than one version of the Pokemon so all moves they used are accounted for.

All Pokemon are LV 14(Strongest level from Brock on Red, Blue, and Yellow versions), OT "BROCK"

Bonus-Suzie's Vulpix that stayed on Brock's team for a long while(OT "SUZIE") and the Ninetales Brock commanded against Team Rocket in one episode (OT "LOKOKO")

I intend on making and posting more PK1 here from the anime before moving on to games and Gen II, so if anyone has a specific character from Indigo League or Orange Islands saga that you want to see and download here, or game character from Red/Blue/Yellow or Pokemon Stadium, feel free to send me a message and ask, I like making those! ^_^
