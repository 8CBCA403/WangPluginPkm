About This File
Lance is one of my favorite Elite 4 members, so I figured I'd turn his team playable. As Yellow was the first Pokemon Game I ever played, I figured his Yellow team would be the one I'd do.

IVs and EVs are standart from CPU opponents on this game,  all of them have no EVs and 8 IVs on all stats except attack which is 9 Ivs. Can't give them infinite PP but I can give PP up to all his Pokemon's attacks, lol.

The most notable thing on Lance's Yellow team is that all his Pokemon know Hyper Beam, and of course, his ace, Dragonite. With Blizzard, Thunder, Fire Blast and Hyper Beam, Lance could probably solo the other three members of the Elite 4 with Dragonite alone if he could outspeed Lorelei's ice types and had good Thunder luck, lol.

(I just might have to make Lorelei's yellow team at one point to compare speed....)

Anyway, enjoy it!
