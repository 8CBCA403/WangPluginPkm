About This File
Fake Event Pokemon I made. Nintendo in future gens did events such as Ash's Pikachu, so I figured, why not? :P

All of Misty's anime Gen I Pokemon with "MISTY" as the OT, at LV 21 (Due to it being Misty's Starmie's level in game), and as bad as this means, movesets taken from the anime.

This means even adding "event moves" for when a Pokemon uses a move on the anime that they can't learn on the game, like Tackle Poliwhirl. Also, Staryu, Goldeen and Psyduck used more than four attacks on the anime, so they have more than one variation so as to cover all moves they used in Gen I.

As a bonus, I also added Anime Misty's Gyarados, who debuted on the anime way after Gen 1, but used enough Gen 1 moves to be done as an event Pokemon here!
