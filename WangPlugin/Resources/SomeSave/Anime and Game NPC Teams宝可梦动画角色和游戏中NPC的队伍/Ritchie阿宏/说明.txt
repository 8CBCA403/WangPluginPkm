About This File
Ritchie's Team, the trainer who has a tendency of catching the same Pokemon as Ash. OT is "RITCHIE".

Unfortunately, Cruise (Gen II, Pupitar) Rose (Gen III, Taillow) and Happy (Gen I, Butterfree) are kinda useless, but alas, those are the moves they showed themselves to be able to use, and I used the Gen Learnsets to decide on their level.

Sadly, only notable thing about those is that Rose has Gust, an anime exclusive move, and Happy has litterally no offensive whatsoever, with Sleep Powder and Whirlwind as her moves, lol.

For Gen I, the others might be stronger, though. Zippo was a Charmander who evolved into Charmeleon, but only ever used exactly 4 moves (including Tackle, an anime exclusive move), so I made Zippo as a charmander at level 46 (when Charmander learns Fire Spin on Gen I) and Zippo as a Charmeleon at lv 56 (when Charmeleon learns Fire Spin). Considering the amount of time it took for Zippo to evolve, the level difference actually makes sense, lol.
